  #[1] Lets begin generating a Model for our application.
  #[2] Type'rails generate model Picture url:string title:string favorite:boolean' into the terminal.
  #   [*] 'rails generate model' is the command.
  #   [*] 'Picture' is the name of our model. Models should represent real-world objects. 
  #   [*] The things at the end such as 'url:string' are attributes - what we will use to describe our models.
  #[3] Once you've generated a model in the terminal go look at it '/app/models/picture.rb'.
